# **Real Estate Price Prediction using Regression Tree**

## **Project Description**
This project uses a **Regression tree model** to predict real estate prices based on various factors such as crime rate, average number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more. The dataset provides information on different housing attributes, and the model aims to predict the median value of homes in thousands of dollars.

The decision tree algorithm is employed to learn patterns in the data and predict house prices based on the provided features.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains multiple features that describe housing characteristics in different areas, along with the target variable, which is the median value of homes (`MEDV`).

| `PTRATIO`                  | Pupil-teacher ratio by town.                                                  |
| `LSTAT`                    | Percentage of lower status population.                                        |
| `MEDV`                     | Median value of homes (target variable).                                      |

## **Model Evaluation**

The decision tree model was trained to predict the median house prices (`MEDV`). You can assess the performance of the model with metrics such as accuracy and mean squared error (MSE).

### **Sample Model Results:**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** X.XX
- **Residual Sum of Squares (MSE):** X.XX
- **RÂ²-Score:** X.XX

(The actual values depend on your model's performance after training and evaluation.)
